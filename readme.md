# JumpyBird
JumpyBird is a 2-D side-scrolling game where the objective is to survive as long as possible by jumping over obstacles in the game. Falling and/or hitting cacti will result in game over and hitting boxes will block the player from moving onward.

## Objective
This project is intended for use as a tutorial and is targeted towards those who have little experience with programming. They should know logical operators (e.g. "and" &&, "or" ||, and "not" !), booleans (i.e. true/false), variables, methods/functions, and "if" statements.
